# SMUS AMI Scope Methodology — Core (v1.0)

This document captures the underlying methodology, rationale, and real-world
contractor considerations behind the AMI Scope Builder core questions.

## D — Materials, Storage, Staging, Disposal

This section exists to surface custody, logistics, regulatory, and risk-allocation issues that materially affect contractor pricing, schedule certainty, and compliance exposure.

### Key Principles
- Clear assignment of custody, loss risk, and disposal responsibility reduces disputes and contingency pricing.
- Material availability and delivery strategy directly affect crew efficiency and mobilization strategy.
- Scale matters: small projects benefit from upfront delivery; large programs require disciplined phased coordination.
- Regulatory and site constraints must be identified early to avoid compliance failures and change orders.

Unknown answers are acceptable and often signal the need for surveys, audits, or SMUS field validation.

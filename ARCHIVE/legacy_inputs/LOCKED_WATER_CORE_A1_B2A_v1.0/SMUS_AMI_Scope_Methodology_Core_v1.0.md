# SMUS AMI Scope Methodology — Core (v1.0)

This document captures the underlying methodology, rationale, and real-world
contractor considerations behind the AMI Scope Builder core questions.

## A3 — Phasing / Pilot Strategy
Phasing exists for two primary reasons:
1) Budget-driven constraints (annual funding caps)
2) Risk-driven pilots (integration, billing, outreach validation)

Best practice is to conduct any required pilot and transition directly into
full deployment without demobilization. Stop-start phasing increases cost due
to staffing disruption and remobilization.

Contractors price continuous work more efficiently. Gaps introduce risk.

## A4 — Labor Compliance and Wage Requirements
Labor is the dominant cost driver in meter installation projects.

Funding source often dictates wage compliance:
- Federal or grant funding may trigger Davis-Bacon
- State or municipal rules may impose prevailing wage or PLAs

Uncertainty leads to contingency pricing. Advance clarification allows:
- Accurate bids
- Avoidance of post-award disputes
- Proper workforce planning

## A5 — Licensing Requirements
Licensing determines legal eligibility to perform work.

Requirements may exist at:
- State level
- County level
- City/municipal level
- Trade-specific level (plumbing, underground utility, engineering)

Inside-set work often triggers stricter licensing than pit work.

Late discovery of licensing requirements can invalidate bids or delay award.

## A6 — Insurance Requirements
Most installation contractors carry:
- Workers’ compensation
- General liability
- Fleet/auto insurance

Professional liability insurance typically applies to engineering or design
services and is not standard for installation contractors.

Misaligned insurance requirements reduce bidder participation.

## A7 — Participation Requirements (MBE/WBE/DBE)
Participation requirements influence:
- Bid scoring
- Subcontracting strategy
- Pricing

While they can expand local participation, they may:
- Increase cost
- Reduce productivity
- Attract firms without AMI installation expertise

Clear disclosure prevents unintended pricing impacts.

## B1 — Legacy Reading Environment
Understanding the existing reading system (Direct Read, AMR, AMI) is critical
for:
- Compatibility planning
- Data migration
- Endpoint removal
- Coexistence during transition

Mixed or unknown environments increase risk and may justify field validation.

## B1a — Vendor / Platform Detail
Specific vendor and endpoint details allow contractors to:
- Confirm compatibility
- Identify integration constraints
- Avoid surprises during cutover

Lack of detail increases contingency pricing.

## B2 — Meter Material and Recycling Value
Meter body material affects:
- Recycling value
- Disposal method
- Handling requirements

Brass meters often have salvage value; plastic/composite generally do not.

Mixed environments increase complexity.

## B2a — Battery Disposal
AMI endpoints often contain lithium batteries requiring regulated disposal.

Battery recycling introduces:
- Per-unit cost
- Environmental compliance requirements
- Scope responsibility questions (utility vs contractor)

Failure to clarify battery handling typically results in pricing contingencies.

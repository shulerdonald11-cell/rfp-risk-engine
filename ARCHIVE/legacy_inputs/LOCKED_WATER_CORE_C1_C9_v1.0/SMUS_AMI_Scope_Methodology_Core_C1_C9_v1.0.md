# SMUS AMI Scope Methodology — Core (C1–C9) v1.0
Status: LOCKED (Verbatim)
Purpose: Preserve Don Shuler IP / reasoning behind outreach, access, and completion governance for reuse in GPT tools, consulting, and training.

## C1 — Customer notification / outreach activities
Many programs require or benefit from pre-notification. For pit-set meters, pre-notification (project notice) helps reduce confusion about why installers are on private property. Day-of-install “knock and notify” is common. Some utilities require 2–3 days or 1-week prior notice via mailer/postcard; door hangers used as pre-notice add cost because they require an extra visit.
Best practice guidance: mailers/postcards are generally most cost-effective for pre-notification. Post-install door hangers are commonly used to confirm work performed, provide flushing instructions, and provide a contact path.

For inside-set meters, contractor/utility databases often lack reliable phone/email. Best practice is a sequenced mailing program to drive inbound calls and scheduling:
- 1st notice to a manageable batch (do not mail thousands at once; match to call-center capacity)
- ~10 days later: 2nd notice to non-responders
- ~10 days later: 3rd/final notice to remaining non-responders
Some programs add door hangers as a final escalation step or push unresolved accounts back to the utility for enforcement action (fees/shutoff warnings where allowed).

Commercial meters often require direct coordination (walk-in/coordination) regardless of the standard approach.

## C2 — Who controls outreach / scheduling communications
PIT-set: the contractor may be fine with utility-led pre-notification when appointments are not required.
Inside-set: outreach and scheduling should generally be contractor-led because scheduling is a balancing act: sequencing mailers, controlling inbound call volume, keeping appointment slots booked, and keeping production stable. If the utility handles it and fails, it becomes a major liability and productivity risk.

## C3 — Languages
Language requirements can drive cost and complexity (translation, printing, and call-center staffing). Identify requirements early and define whether the utility provides approved translations/templates or expects contractor drafts for utility approval.

## C4 — Call center requirement for PIT-set
Inside-set requires contractor call center and dispatch, period. This question is mainly to confirm whether the utility is requiring a call center for pit-set work (often only needed for day-of-install issues).

## C5 — Leave-behind material requirements
Sometimes there are additional utility-specified leave-behind materials, especially for inside-set appointments. For pit-set, a post-install door hanger is the standard leave-behind.

## C6 — Content ownership / approvals for printed materials
For any material distribution (pre-install letters, door hangers, post-install leave-behinds), the contractor will lean on the utility to provide the content or approve final content. The contractor may provide drafts/examples, but the utility must approve before printing/distribution.

## C7 — Enforcement mechanisms to drive completion
Unresolved access/no-response/refusals can stall completion. Without enforcement mechanisms, programs can plateau and leave a meaningful percentage unconverted. Enforcement tools are utility-side (fees, shutoff/hold where allowed, formal notices). Contractor role is to document attempts and disposition accounts (UIR/RTU) per policy.

## C8 — Workflow closure treatment of unresolved locations
Define thresholds and disposition rules so crews can maintain productivity. If unresolved locations force endless revisits or block progression, productivity drops and cost increases. Common approach is RTU after defined attempts with documentation.

## C9 — Commercial/payment treatment of unsuccessful attempts
If payment is completion-only while enforcement is weak, contractors will price contingency or disputes will occur. Define how unsuccessful attempts, RTU/UIR, locked gates, refusals, and return visits are treated for payment and closeout to avoid change orders and scope disputes.

      "helperText": "Best practice: Use mailers/postcards for pre-install notification when required, and use a post-install door hanger to confirm the work performed, provide flushing instructions, and provide contact information. Door hangers used as advance notice typically add cost because they require an extra site visit.",
      "notePrompt": "In Notes, describe PIT vs inside-set differences, how many pre-notice attempts are required (1st/2nd/final), timing (days between notices), whether commercial meters require appointment coordination, and whether enforcement steps (fees/shutoff) are allowed after defined no-response thresholds.",
      "implications": [
        "Pre-install outreach helps reduce customer complaints and confusion (especially for pit-set installs where technicians are on private property).",
        "Door hangers used as advance notice increase labor cost and reduce installation efficiency because they can require additional site visits.",
        "Indoor access programs typically require sequenced mailers aligned to call center capacity to drive scheduling and maximize completion.",
        "Commercial meters often require direct coordination regardless of the standard notification plan.",
        "Unclear notification rules often lead to incomplete installs, schedule delays, or contractor contingency pricing."
